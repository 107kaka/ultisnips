- document new option InterfaceFlavour

- implement filetype specific configuration like this:
    let s:c.ft = get(s:c, 'use_shipped_filetypes', {})
    let s:c.ft.php = get(s:c.ft, 'php', ['*'])
    let s:c.ft.xml = get(s:c.ft, 'xml', ['UltiSnips'])
    let s:c.ft.javascript = get(s:c.ft, 'xml', ['*'])


- think about how to extract tcomment's filetype detection
  so that you get js completion in haml files in js sections etc.

- keep thing working, thus keep snipmate as is but add big warnings that
  users should switch to UltiSnips

- think about how to keep the feature that snippets can be patched and
  duplicated so that versions with and without markers can be used without
  redundancy

- introduce SnipmateOpenSnippetFiles command

- wait for Holger Rapp to split snippets into its own repository, so that that
  can be merged with snipmate-snippets

- tell the mailinglist about this snippet community merge

- think about refactoring plugin/* beacuse that directory should only
  contain code which get loaded on each startup. It should only contain the
  interface declaration. Everything else should be moved to autoload or such

- adopt
g:UltiSnipsUsePythonVersion
g:UltiSnipsNoPythonWarning

to new configuration style (move it below 

- think about whether to keep the plugin already sourced guard.
  It always annoys me.
