UltiSnips
=========

NOTE: Official repo: https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips
This is a fork. Previously this was the snipmate-merge branch.
Using branch master so that people can install and give it a try more easily.
The main author of UltiSnips knows about the fork. Its me not having time to
update the test suite. That's preventing it from being merged upstream.

New features:
- snipmate like completion
- snippet files are reloaded if timestamp changes
- snipame snippet support (they are converted on the fly, if there are errors
  the converted result is put into a bufffer and quickfix is populated)

!! See comments at plugin/UltiSnips.vim 


Note that we do not use the Issue tracker here one GitHub because the one on
Launchpad is superior and already has a significant history. Please report
`issues over there`_.
